## üìñ Detailed overview

This component allows you to add the Disqus widget.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

1.  Add the component to the page
2.  Specify the `Discussion identifier`, `Discussion URL` and `Discussion title` on the Props panel
3.  See how it works in the preview mode

### Discussion URL

If the value of the `Discussion URL` property isn't set, the URL of the current page with the component will be applied automatically. Since the URLs in the builder and on the published site are different, we recommend that you manually set a unique URL to display a common comment form.

### Identifiers

Discussion identifier, URL, and title are created and saved when the first comment is added. Learn more about it [here](https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1717111-what-s-a-shortname).

### Your feed name (Shortname)

To get `Your feed name` (Shortname):

1.  Sign up for [Disqus](https://disqus.com/profile/signup/)
2.  Go to the [Disqus comment creation page](https://disqus.com/admin/create) for your site
