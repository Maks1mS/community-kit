### Elements alignment

The `Alignment on desktop` and `Alignment on mobile` props allow you to align elements the way you need on different devices.

By default, the following alignment options are available for the `Alignment on desktop` prop:

-   From left (staggered)
-   From right (staggered)
-   Left
-   Right

The value chosen in the `Alignment on mobile` prop will be applied for the breakpoint specified in the `Mobile view start with breakpoint` prop.
