The user can change it during payment.

### Button text

By default, there are 4 button text options in the YooMoney form: `Transfer`, `Send`, `Send`, `Donate`. You can choose them with the `Button text` property using their IDs:

-   `11` - "Transfer"
-   `12` - "Send"

### Collecting info during the transfer

During the transfer, you can ask the sender their full name, email, phone number, and address. To request all this, enable the corresponding properties from the `"INFO"` category.
